# Gunsense

A surveillance & security computer vision project.

## Licensing

Gunsense is licensed under ___; a non-restrictive, copy-left license.

## Disclaimer

This project CANNOT be relied upon for realworld surveillance situations.
As it stands, this code is intended for hobby and research purposes. 

## Requirements

1. A CUDA-compatible GPU for effective processing capabilities
2. Python >= 3.10

## Setup

Gunsense can be installed in a few easy steps.

## Background

In the 21st century, gun violence is a major issue across the globe (but more
specifically in the United States). While we can and should work towards
preventing these horrible crimes, we should also focus on developing technology
to effectively respond to them.

## Technologies

This project is pure, 100% Python. 

I'm primarily using the three following frameworks/libraries/APIs:
  1. OpenCV
    - 
  2. MediaPipe 
    - 
  3. Tensorflow
    - 

## Approach

## Logging

There are three types of gunsense loggers:

1. Stdout
  - Error, event, and threat logging (in stdout/stream)
2. File
  - Error, event, and threat logging (on disk)
3. Image
  - Timestamped images of potential threats
  - Stored alongside the text file log
